#MSU-Schedule-Builder
Create a sample 4 year schedule given a degree program.

#Desired Result for End-Users

I want this easily accessible online. The webpage should be mobile-friendly. According to the following queries, I want the page to display the results, followed by optional excel and pdf downloads.

1.   Up to three degree programs.
2.   Up to three minor fields of study.
3.   Current year of study.
4.   Willingness to study over summer. 

#More Specs

1.  Limit third-party dependencies. I don't want 90-percent of the code becoming useless when some import updates.
2.  Keep it local. It's time consuming to keep pulling source code from the source. Do it once, then pull from file.

Everything we need is online at the MSU Registrar's Office.

1. Clean course data.
2. Think about how are we going to store program requirements.
3. Create csv for program requirements.
